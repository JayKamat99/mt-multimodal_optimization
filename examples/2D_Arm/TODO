[x] get a path using sparse roadmap planner.

[ ] see if you can interpolate for the points and make an animation.

[ ] Use those points to optimize the trajectory.

[ ] >Use planner of Andreas to get multimodal solutions. Vsualize it.

[ ] See how to run code of Andreas. [Urgent]

[ ] Use Torus as statespace.
